### What I'm Doing Currently

I am the lead full stack developer at [Instra.AI](https://github.com/Instra-AI).

I also consult for [F & B Wholesale](https://www.fbwholesale.biz) creating their website and auction system.

I am a senior getting my bachelor's in computer science.

Finally I spend my free time playing Valorant and competing on my college's esports team.
